    two of the most common tasks we have to perform as JavaScript devs. In this article, we will\
    discuss the best approaches to combine async/await and iterative logic. There will be a time \
    when you would want to run async operations inside for loops (or any type of other loops). \
    Letâ€™s take a look at how to deal with such situations. In the code above we have a simple async \
    function called someFunction, it takes in an array as a parameter, \
    iterates the array and for each item makes an API request (via out fake API function). \
    In this case, we want to resolve the API calls in sequence.\
    We want our output to print the following",
